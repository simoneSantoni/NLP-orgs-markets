# Gender-based stereotypes in job posts

**Context**

You work for a consultancy company that has been asked to quantify the extent to which job post descriptions mirror gender-based stereotypes — that is, they contain words that have a connotation in terms of gender. Your client is a governmental agency dealing with labor policy issues.

**Expectations**

You’re supposed to work with the [Indeed Job Posting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/promptcloud/indeed-job-posting-dataset) available in Kaggle to appreciate:

- how/to what extent job descriptions show a gender stereotype
- the extent to which the magnitude of the gender stereotype changes across job titles, ranks, sectors, and so on and so forth.
